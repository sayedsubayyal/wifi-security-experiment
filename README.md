# Wi-Fi Security Experiment: WPA2 vs WPA3

> **Educational lab experiment** comparing WPA2 and WPA3 Wi-Fi security using Wifite.

---

##  Objective
Conduct a controlled lab experiment to explore how **WPA2-PSK** and **WPA3-SAE** react to offline dictionary attacks, and to observe the behavior of tools like **Wifite** in each scenario. All testing was performed in a private, permitted environment.

---

##  Tools & Lab Setup
- **OS:** Kali Linux with built-in wireless adapter  
- **Tool:** Wifite (leveraging Aircrack-ng for cracking)  
- **Test Networks:**
  - WPA2-PSK secured network (numeric-only password)
  - WPA3-SAE secured network (similar password setup)

---

##  Experiment Steps
1. **WPA2 Testing**
   - Captured the WPA2 handshake with Wifite.
   - Used a numeric-only wordlist for password cracking.
   - Successfully cracked the WPA2 password when it was purely numeric.

2. **WPA3 Testing**
   - Attempted the same process against WPA3.
   - Wifite failed, as WPA3 uses **SAE**, which resists offline cracking.

---

##  Results & Insights
- **WPA2 vulnerability**: Offline dictionary attacks effective when passwords are weak (e.g., numeric only).
- **WPA3 strength**: SAE-based authentication resists this type of attack.
- **Wordlist significance**: Cracking success depends on complexity and coverage.
- Wifite is **useful for learning WPA2 weaknesses**, but not effective against WPA3.

---

##  Key Learnings
- Use **strong, complex passwords** (mix of letters, numbers, symbols).
- WPA3 adoption significantly improves Wi-Fi security.
- Ethical hacking experiments must be confined to controlled environments.
- Tools like `crunch` can help generate comprehensive wordlists for realistic testing.

---

##  Disclaimer
This experiment was conducted strictly for **educational and ethical purposes** in a controlled lab setup. It does **not** endorse or promote unauthorized access to any networks.

---

###  Optional Enhancements
- **Screenshots or command logs** (like handshake capture or Wifite output) can add visual clarityâ€”ensure no sensitive data is exposed.
- A simple **diagram or workflow**, illustrating steps from "Capture handshake â†’ Crack WPA2 â†’ Attempt WPA3."
- A short **video clip or GIF** (if possible) showing the Wifite process (optional, but engaging!).

## 2. Enhancing LinkedIn Presence

You can present this experiment on LinkedIn in two formats:

###  A. Quick Post (Concise & Eye-Catching)
**Example content:**

ðŸš€ Just wrapped up a mini lab experiment exploring WPA2 vs WPA3 Wi-Fi security!

â€¢ Cracked WPA2 when the password was weak (numeric-only).
â€¢ Tried cracking WPA3â€”no luck, thanks to SAE (a win for modern security).

âœ… Key takeaway: Always choose strong passwords and upgrade to WPA3 where possible.

###  B. LinkedIn Article (Detailed & Professional)
Use LinkedIn's **"Write Article"** feature to post the full README you created. Structure it with headings, maybe add an image (e.g. Wi-Fi icon or Kali logo), then publish. It becomes a shareable piece of your portfolioâ€”professionally showcasing your skills and approach.

---

### TL;DR
- **GitHub**: Paste the polished README above into your repo for clarity, structure, and professionalism.
- **LinkedIn**: Use either a short, engaging post or publish the full experiment as an article to highlight your cybersecurity skills and learning process.
